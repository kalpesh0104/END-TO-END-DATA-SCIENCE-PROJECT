"Decsription":

This project helps predict if a patient might be readmitted to the hospital soon after they’ve been discharged. It uses details like the person’s age, gender, number of days they stayed in the hospital, lab tests done, and how many medicines they were given. We train a computer model using this data so it can learn patterns. Then we create a simple web-based tool (API) using FastAPI so that doctors or staff can enter new patient info and get a quick risk prediction. If the risk is high, they can give extra care or follow-up. The prediction is shown instantly in the browser. It’s like a mini assistant that helps make better hospital decisions using data.
